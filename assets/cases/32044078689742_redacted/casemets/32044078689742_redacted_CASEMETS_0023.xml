                <p id="b220-10" pgmap="220(161) 221(46)">The appellant, John E. Kavanagh, filed a bill to wind up the affairs of the appellee Bank of America and for the appointment of a receiver as a means to ac­complish that end. Daniel D. Healy was appointed such receiver. In the process of the administration of the bank, the marshalling of its assets and in as­certaining its liabilities, one Gilbert C. Pryor in an in­tervening petition presented a claim as assignee of six certificates of deposit of the Bank of America, each for the sum of $2,500. On June 10, 1907, after a hearing-­before the chancellor, the claim was allowed for $15,903.42, the amount of principal and interest due on the six certificates of deposit, and a decree entered to that purport and directing- “that said receiver be and he is hereby ordered, adjudged and decreed to pay to said Gilbert C. Pryor the said sum of fifteen thousand nine hundred and three dollars and forty-­two cents ($15,903.42) forthwith”. From this finding and decree John E. Kavanagh prayed, was allowed and perfected an appeal to this court. Daniel D. Healy, the receiver, also prayed and perfected an appeal to this court, but has since caused his appeal to be dis­missed.</p>
                <p id="b221-4" pgmap="221">The material findings of the decree are as follows: “That the said Gilbert G. Pryor is the holder and owner of six certificates of deposit, each dated the 15th day of January, 1906, for twenty-five hundred dollars * * * respectively, due respectively, two in five, two in six and two in seven months after date, all of said certificates being payable to the order of F. E. Creel­man and by the said F. E. Creelman endorsed in blank; that the said F. E. Creelman sold the said certificates of deposit to the Jackson Trust &amp; Savings Bank and the Jackson Trust &amp; Savings Bank received such cer­tificates in the regular course of business for a val­uable consideration, namely, the sum of fifteen thou­sand dollars * * * in money paid by the said Jackson Trust &amp; Savings Bank to said F. E.

                <p id="b222-15" pgmap="222">Counsel for intervener stated upon the trial that they would agree that any defense that could be made against the bank—meaning the Jackson Trust &amp; Sav­ings Bank—could be used against Pryor.</p>
                <p id="b222-16" pgmap="222">In view of this concession we will now determine the rights of the Jackson Trust &amp; Savings Bank as affecting the character of the title which they trans­mitted to the intervener claimant, Pryor.</p>
                <p id="b222-17" pgmap="222">While, as we have already said, the proof sustains the findings of fact in the decree, neverthelesss the right of recovery depends upon the application of prin­ciples of law governing and controlling such facts.</p>
                <p id="b222-18" pgmap="222">The burden of the argument of appellant is devoted to two propositions:</p>
                <p id="b222-19" pgmap="222(28) 223(25)">First. That the Bank which acquired the certifi­cates of deposit from Creelman is not an innocent as­signee of such certificates in the usual course of busi­ness, and that Pryor is not the holder by assignment from the bank. These contentions involve an attack upon the probative force of the facts.</p>
                <p id="b223-4" pgmap="223">Second. That “where fraud in the inception and is­suance of negotiable paper is shown by the maker, the burden is on the indorser to prove himself to be an in­nocent holder”. This raises the questions of law in the case and leaves for our decision whether the last quoted statement announces a legal proposition which, upon the facts in the record, inhibit a recovery.</p>
                <p id="b223-5" pgmap="223">First. The evidence, uncontradicted, of Lawton, the cashier of the Jackson Bank, called by appellant and made his own witness, thereby vouching for his credi­bility, was that he did not know how the certificates were obtained by Creelman from the Bank of America; that these certificates were purchased and received by the Jackson Bank in the regular course of business. Lawton was the cashier of the bank and as such re­ceived the certificates from Creelman. Creelman, it is true, had many other dealings with the Jackson Bank, and at the time of negotiating the certificates in suit was an officer and stockholder of the Bank of America, whose fidelity in his dealings with that bank is challenged in the bill filed for a receiver. That many irregularities were practiced by the president and other officers of the bank, to its detriment and ruin, are matters of judicial history. No knowledge that any fraud was practiced in the procuring of these six certificates from the Bank of America by Creelman or any one else, is fastened upon the Jackson Bank or its officers by the proof in the record; nor is any such knowledge reasonably inferable from any proof therein.</p>
                <p id="b223-6" pgmap="223(55) 224(292)">In the light of the stipulation orally made at the conclusion of the evidence for the defense by counsel for intervenor, and impliedly, for want of objection or challenge upon the part of any one defending, ac­quiesced in by appellant, we think it is immaterial whether evidence is in this record sustaining title of Pryor in the certificates as assignee of the Jackson Bank. Mr. Adams, speaking’ for the intervenor, at the close of the defense said: “It is stipulated that the case shall proceed the same as if the Jackson Trust &amp; Savings Bank were the real plaintiffs here in the place of Pryor, trustee, and that no point will be raised by reason of the fact that Pryor, trustee, failed to show that he paid any actual consideration for those certifi­cates to the Jackson Trust &amp; Savings Bank”. This stipulation was, in its effect, a concession to appellant and favorable to the defense, as it eliminated tile ques­tion of the protection which the law extends to re­mote assignees for value of such banking paper ac­quired before maturity and without knowledge, actual or imputable, of irregularities in their issue or fraud in obtaining them. This requirement was waived, and appellant is now estopped to make the objection on ap­peal which he impliedly, at least, waived on the trial. Aside, however, from these considerations, we find evi­dence in the record, uncontradicted, that Pryor actually paid the Jackson Bank $15,000 and accrued interest for the certificates at the time they were delivered to him, before their maturity. Such delivery by the Jackson Bank without further endorsement was sufficient to vest the title to them in Pryor. The indorsement by Creel-­man of these certificates made them, in legal effect, payable to bearer, so that the title to them would pass by delivery to a third party, and no further indorse­ment was needed to pass the title. Authorities sus­taining this proposition will be found in the Encyclo­paedia of Law &amp; Procedure, vol. 7, p. 759, and cases there cited.</p>
                <p id="b224-5" pgmap="224(65) 225(23)">Second. It is contended .that the certificates of de­posit are not negotiable instruments within the mean­ing of- the statutes of this state on that subject, and not being negotiable the Bank of America may avail of all defenses, legal and equitable, which it might make were such certificates in the hands of the original owner. It is further urged that these certificates are not negotiable under the Negotiable Instrument Act. Chapter 98, B. S. and Sections 3 and 4, are cited in support of such claim.</p>
                <p id="b225-4" pgmap="225">Section 3 provides that “All promissory notes, bonds, due-bills and other instruments in writing made or to be made by any person * * * whereby such person promises or agrees to pay' any sum of money * * * or acknowledges any sum of money * * * to be due to any other person, shall be taken to be due and payable, the sum of money * * * therein mentioned by virtue thereof to be due and pay­able as therein expressed”.</p>
                <p id="b225-9" pgmap="225">The certificates in question contain the quality and indicia of instruments in writing made by the Bank of America—an artificial person promising to pay a sum certain to a person named, at a definite time, with interest at a specified rate on surrender of the certificates properly indorsed. The statute is not con­fined in its operation to promissory notes, bills of exchange or due-bills, but includes instruments in writing of the nature of these certificates. To obtain payment when due, the certificates must be surren­dered duly indorsed. The indorsement means that of the person named in the certificate. When so indorsed and offered for surrender, the amount due is payable to the person presenting the same for surrender and payment. The certificates when indorsed in blank are, by operation of law, payable to bearer.</p>
                <p id="b225-10" pgmap="225(96) 226(34)">Section 4 supra provides that “any such note, bond, bill or other instrument in writing, payable to any person named as payee therein, shall be assign­able by indorsement thereon under the hand of such person. * * *” Applying this section to the certifi­cates, the person named therein, F. E. Creelman, is the payee, and they were assignable by his indorsement un­der his hand. The certificates are therefore negotiable instruments and were assignable by the indorsement of Creelman and payable to the person to whom they were delivered upon surrender. Furthermore, it was decided in Telford v. Patton, 144 Ill. 611, that a cer­tificate of deposit is in fact and law a promissory note for the payment of money. Beckstrom v. Krone, 125 Ill. App. 376.</p>
                <p id="b226-5" pgmap="226">We think that in every material particular the cer­tificates of deposit have all the essential qualities of a promissory note as defined in Dorsey v. Wolff, 142 Ill. 589, where the court say: “Various definitions have been given of a promissory note. In general terms, it may be defined to be a written promise by one person to pay another person therein named, or order, a fixed sum of money at all events and at a time specified therein, or at a time which certainly must arrive”.</p>
                <p id="b226-6" pgmap="226(228) 227(181)">Certificates of deposit of the character of those in the record pertain to the business of banking, and are issued, generally, in the usual course of the business of bankers. They are as well recognized and under­stood in the business world of today as a legitimate method and means of banking, as the dealing of bank­ers in domestic and foreign bills of exchange, due bills and other negotiable paper, have been for centuries recognized and understood as the major part of the active business of bankers and banking. These certifi­cates were issued by the accredited officers of the Bank of America to Creelman in the usual course of the business of the bank. They passed current among bankers as assignable, negotiable paper. As we have hereinbefore demonstrated, they are negotiable instru­ments, the title to which passes by indorsement and delivery. But it is insisted that there are equitable defenses to the certificates between the maker and Creelman, and that those defenses can be successfully interposed against the intervenor and the assignee, the Jackson Bank. These defenses go, in the main, to the adequacy of the consideration moving from Creelman to the bank, involving also the integrity of the Bank of America’s executive officers. Whatever the facts regarding such contentions may be, the record fails to connect either the officers of the Jackson Bank or Pryor with knowledge, in the slightest degree, of any illegal conduct or fraud or conspiracy between the bank’s officers and Creelman in the obtaining of the certificates. The whole argument rests for its support in surmise and conjecture, upon the apparent assump­tion that Creelman, in his dealings with the Jackson Bank, had developed such a character as an unsound and unsafe financier that his possession of the certifi­cates was sufficient to raise a presumption that he ob­tained them irregularly and that they were not issued to him by the Bank of America in the regular course of its business. With proof that the certificates were acquired by the Jackson Bank from Creelman for full value paid by the bank to Creelman, that for such con­sideration they were indorsed and delivered by Creel­man to the Jackson Bank before maturity, and that they were subsequently delivered by the bank, without further indorsement, to Pryor, the latter made a prima facie case against the receiver for an allowance of the amount of the principal and interest due upon them.</p>
                <p id="b227-4" pgmap="227(173) 228(59)">The evidence given in defense failed to fasten upon either the Jackson Bank or Pryor knowledge of any fraud or irregularity in their issue, or that they were in fact issued without consideration. The fact, if it be a fact, that the consideration for the issue of the certificates was inadequate, or that the officers of the Bank of America issued them without due regard to their duty as officers of the bank, or in disregard of such duty, did not impute knowledge to the Jackson Bank or Pryor of these derelictions upon the part of the bank’s officers, making it necessary for Pryor to put in any rebutting proof. There is no pretense that any fraud or deception was practiced by Creelman in procuring the execution and delivery of the six certifi­ficates to him by the Bank of America, nor is there any evidence that they were not issued in the usual course of the business of the Bank of America. Fraud or de­ception necessary to invalidate the certificates, must have been practiced in the obtaining of them in the first instance. Inadequacy of consideration will not invalidate them .in the hands of an innocent holder for value before maturity. Martina v. Muhlke, 186 Ill. 330; Richelieu Hotel Co. v. Mil. Enc. Co., 140 ibid. 257; Bradwell v. Pryor, 221 ibid. 606; Connolly, Admr., v. Dammann, 232 ibid, 175.</p>
                <p id="AU2" pgmap="228">Lawton, the cashier, was the officer of the bank who bought the certificates-from Creelman for the Jackson Bank, and we see nothing in this record needing any contradiction by Eagan, the president of the Jackson Bank, or justifying any inference that Eagan had any knowledge of any frauds by the bank officers in issuing the certificates or on the part of Creelman in obtaining them.</p>
                <p id="b228-6" pgmap="228">There is nothing in the reported conversation be­tween Daoust of the Defiance Bank and Eagan which tends to charge Eagan with knowledge of any irregu­larities or frauds in the issuing of the certificates to Creelman, imposing upon Eagan the necessity of testi­fying in contradiction. Nothing in this record tends to prove a common design on the part of Creelman and the officers of the Bank of America and any of­ficers of the Jackson Bank of conspiring to defraud the Bank of America in procuring the issuance of the six certificates of deposit in dispute. Nor do any of the eases cited by appellant hold to any such doctrine on facts anywhere near similar to those in the case at bar.</p>
                <p id="b228-7" pgmap="228">The objection is made that the direction in the de­cree to the receiver, to pay the amount found due on the certificates “forthwith” is contrary to the usual course and practice in cases of claims ordered paid by receivers in liquidation proceedings, and that the or­der should have been that the amount found due should be paid by the receiver in the due course of the ad­ministration of the bank’s estate. The costs of liqui­dation, including receiver’s charges, are primarily payable from the assets of a concern in liquidation</p>
                <p id="b229-3" pgmap="229">before the receiver pays other claims. We think this objection is well taken, but it does not necessarily re­quire a reversal of the chancellor’s decree.</p>
                <p id="b229-4" pgmap="229">The decree of the Superior Court will be modified by striking out of it the last word thereof, viz, “forth­with”, and inserting in its place the words, “in due course of the administration of the estate of said Bank of America in liquidation in this court”.</p>
                <p id="b229-5" pgmap="229">And as so modified the decree of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>
                <p id="b229-6" pgmap="229">Affirmed.</p>
